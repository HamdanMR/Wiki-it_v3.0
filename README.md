Wiki-it_v3.0
============

Voice driven Wiki-it app for Android <br>
This app is mainly built for blind. One can search wiki by just voicing the topic, find results, go to particular content or even listen to whole of article.<br>
Wikipedia has following types of content: <br>
1.Text <br>
2.Links <br>
3.Tables <br>
4.Images <br>
<br>
We can handle: <br>
1.Text-   looks simple. We can use text-to-speech to convert them to speech.  <br>
2.Links-  Hopefully using some keywords, something like 'go to'. <br>
3.Tables- Common text is in p tag and tables are in table tag. Hopefully we can exploit it. <br>
4.Image-  Img tag can be used.  <br>
