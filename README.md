Wiki-it_v3.0
============

**Description:**
Voice driven Wiki-it app for Android
This app is mainly built for blind. One can search wiki by just voicing the topic, find results, go to particular content or even listen to whole of article.
Wikipedia has following types of content: 
1.Text 
2.Links 
3.Tables 
4.Images

We can handle: 
1.Text-   looks simple. We can use text-to-speech to convert them to speech.  
2.Links-  Hopefully using some keywords, something like 'go to'. 
3.Tables- Common text is in p tag and tables are in table tag. Hopefully we can exploit it. 
4.Image-  Img tag can be used.
